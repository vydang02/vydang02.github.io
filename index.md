## About Me

Hello! I'm Vy, a data-driven analyst at the intersection of business strategy and statistical methods. With a dual background in Business Administration and Statistics from the University of Michigan, I transform complex datasets into actionable business insights across economic research, consulting, and financial analysis domains.

My core strengths include:

* Developing statistical models that illuminate market dynamics and economic trends
* Translating complex quantitative findings into clear, accessible recommendations
* Designing data workflows that enhance accuracy and streamline decision-making processes
* Applying analytical rigor to business challenges through Python, R, and Stata implementations

I excel at bridging quantitative analysis with strategic thinking, consistently delivering data-driven solutions that enhance business performance and provide competitive intelligence across diverse industry contexts.

## Projects

### Credit Card Fraud Analytics
*Python (PyTorch, Pandas, NumPy)* | [View Project](https://github.com/vydang02/STATS-507-Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection-NLP-Model)

![](/images/credit_card_fraud.jpg)


An end-to-end machine learning project focused on detecting fraudulent credit card transactions. Using a dataset of over 1 million transactions, I built a cost-sensitive fraud detection model that improved accuracy by 15% and reduced false positives by 20%.

**Key techniques:** Anomaly detection, logistic regression, cost-sensitive learning, class imbalance handling

### Tennessee STAR Education Analysis
*R* | [View Project](https://github.com/vydang02/Tennessee-STAR-EDA-Project)

![](/images/class-project.jpg)

Exploratory data analysis of Tennessee's Student-Teacher Achievement Ratio (STAR) experiment, examining how class sizes impact student performance across different demographics. This project involved cleaning and analyzing 11,000+ student records across a 4-year longitudinal study.

**Key techniques:** Hypothesis testing, multiple regression analysis, data visualization, causal inference
