## About Me

Hello! I'm Vy, a Business and Statistics student at the University of Michigan passionate about using data to solve real-world problems. I enjoy working at the intersection of business strategy and quantitative analysis, with experience spanning economic research, consulting, and data science.

When I'm not coding or analyzing data, you can find me [your hobbies/interests here].

## Projects

### Credit Card Fraud Analytics
*Python (PyTorch, Pandas, NumPy)* | [View Project](#)

An end-to-end machine learning project focused on detecting fraudulent credit card transactions. Using a dataset of over 1 million transactions, I built a cost-sensitive fraud detection model that improved accuracy by 15% and reduced false positives by 20%.

**Key techniques:** Anomaly detection, logistic regression, cost-sensitive learning, class imbalance handling

### Tennessee STAR Education Analysis
*R* | [View Project](#)

Exploratory data analysis of Tennessee's Student-Teacher Achievement Ratio (STAR) experiment, examining how class sizes impact student performance across different demographics. This project involved cleaning and analyzing 11,000+ student records across a 4-year longitudinal study.

**Key techniques:** Hypothesis testing, multiple regression analysis, data visualization, causal inference
